#Conditional Statement Overview
#age = int(input("Enter age: "))

#if age >= 21:
    #print("You are of legal age to buy adult beverages")
    #quantity = int(input("Enter quantity: "))
    
    #total_price = quantity * 1.99
    #print(f"You owe ${total_price}")
#else:
    #print("You are not of the legal drinking age.")


#count = 5

#if count == 5:
    #print("Same")
    
# Output is "Same"

#if count != 10:
    #print("These are not equal")

# Output is "These are not equal"

#if count > 3:
    #print("5 is greater than 3")

# Output is "5 is greater than 3"

#if count < 7:
    #print("5 is less than 7")

# Output is "5 is less than 7"

#if count >= 5:
    #print("5 is greater than or is 5")

# Output is "5 is greater than or is 5"

#if count <= 6:
    #print("5 is less than or is 5")

# Output is "5 is less than or is 5"

#Exercise 1
#Create a variable to store a number
number = 7

# Prompting user to guess a number between 1-10 and store value
value = int(input("Choose a number between 1 and 10: "))

# Create if statement to check if user guess is true
if value == number:
    print("You are correct")
else: print("Try again")

#number_one = 5
#number_two = 5
#number_three = 10

#if number_one == 5 and number_one < number_three:
    #print("5 is equal to 5 and 5 is less than 10")
    
# output "5 is equal to 5 and 5 is less than 10"

#if number_one > 3 or number_three < number_two:
    #print("5 is greater than 3")
    
# The above code is checking to see if 5 is greater than 3 
# or if 10 is less than 5, as long as one is True
# the indented code will be executed

#Exercise 2
# Prompting user for their income and storing value
gross_income = int(input("What is your annual gross income?: "))

# Prompting user for their credit score and storing value
credit_score = int(input("What is your credit score?: "))

if gross_income > 50000 and credit_score > 650:
    print("You are approved")
else: print("You are not approved")

#age = 21

#if age > 21:
    #print("You may enter.")
#else: print("You may not enter.")

#Exercise 3
# Creating secret word and storing in variable
secret_word = "abracadabra"

# Prompting user to guess the secret word
user_word = input("Guess the secret word: ")

# Create if statement to check if user guess is true
if user_word == secret_word:
    print("You guessed correctly")
else: print(user_word.lower("Your guess is incorrect"))

#name = "Andrea"

#print(name.lower())
# Output would be "andrea"

#print(name.upper())
# Output would be "ANDREA"

#keep_going = input("Would you like to continue?: ")

#if keep_going == "yes":
    #print("We are continuing")
#elif keep_going == "no":
    #print("We are stopping")
#else:
    #print("Please enter a yes or no")

# Exercise 4
# Pprompting user for a number
first_number = int(input("Enter first number: "))

# Prompting user for a second number 
second_number = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Print user to choose calculator function
function = int((input("Would you like to Add[1], Subtract[2], Multiply[3], Divide[4]?: ")))

if function == 1:
    print(first_number + second_number)
elif function == 2:
    print(first_number - second_number)
elif function == 3:
    print(first_number * second_number)
elif function == 4:
    print(first_number / second_number)
else: print("Please enter a valid choice")
