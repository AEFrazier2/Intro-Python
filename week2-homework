#Exercise 1
# Prompting user for the degrees in Farenheit
fahrenheit = float(input("Enter degrees in fahrenheit: "))
# Converting fahrenheit to celsius
celsius = round((fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9, 1)
# Print degrees fahrenheit and it's celsius equivalent
print(f"{fahrenheit} in Fahrenheit is equal to {celsius} in Celsius")

#Exercise 2
# Prompting user to give price of product before taxes
pre_tax_price = float(input("Enter the product price: "))
# Prompting user to give sales tax at 6%
sales_tax = float(input("Enter sales tax at 6%: "))
# Print total product price including 6% sales tax
print(float(pre_tax_price + sales_tax))

#Exercise 2
# Prompting user to give price of product before taxes
pre_tax_price = float(input("Enter the product price: "))
# Prompting user to give sales tax
sales_tax = int(input("Enter sales tax percentage: "))
# Print total product price including sales tax
print(float(pre_tax_price) + (round(pre_tax_price * .06, 2)))

#Exercise 3
# Prompting user to give total bill amount
total_bill_amount = float(input("Enter total amount of bill: "))
# Prompting user to give the percentage of the tip they would like to give
percentage_tip = int(input("Enter the percentage tip: "))
# Print amount of tip due
print(float(total_bill_amount) * (round(percentage_tip / 100, 2)))

#Exercise 4
# Prompting the user to give total bill amount
total_bill_amount = float(input("Enter total amount of bill: "))
# Prompting the user for number of people contributing
contributors = int(input("How many people are contributing: "))
# Print amount owed for each contributor
print(float(round(total_bill_amount/contributors, 2)))
